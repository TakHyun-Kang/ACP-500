      <h3>Question: 22</h3>
      <p>
        Your Project Management Office asks you to install a popular Confluence app which embeds spreadsheet-like abilities in Confluence.<br />
        The app requires its data to be stored in a separate database, not the one that Confluence uses.<br />
        How might this affect your management of the Confluence server?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. The memory allocated to Confluence will need to increase 150%.<br />
        B. Multiple database connections for this app will compete with database connections for Confluence.<br />
        C. The Confluence indexing engine will need to be configured to scan the new database.<br />
        D. You will not be able to rely on the optional daily XML backups produced by Confluence.

      <h3>Question: 24</h3>
      <p>
        You received a new ticket that asks you to install a certain app on your production system using an evaluation license.<br />
        The requestor states that it should not be a problem to install the app on the production system, as it can be removed afterwards.<br />
        Why could this cause confusion for end users?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. The app could create objects (e.g. issuetypes, projecttypes, etc.) which will remain after uninstallation.<br />
        B. The app could create new directories (e.g. cache, indexing, storage, etc.) in Jira’s home directory.<br />
        C. The app could change user information which remains changed after uninstallation.<br />
        D. The app could add an item to the main menu which remains after uninstallation.<br />
        E. The app could create new directories (e.g. install, config, etc.) in Jira’s install directory.<br />
        F. The app could create new tables in Jira’s database which will remain after uninstallation.

      <h3>Question: 26</h3>
      <p>
        Leo is concerned because his Confluence Server randomly becomes unresponsive at least three times a week, with no pattern to help diagnose the problem. Each time, he has to reboot the server. This resolves the problem until the next random episode.<br />
        The Marketing team typically asks Leo to install about 5 Atlassian apps per week, for them to evaluate. So far this year, he’s installed over 60 apps for them. He has disabled some of these from the system. The rest remain enabled.<br />
        What will be the most effective step for Leo to bring stability back to the system, and why?
      </p>
      <p>
        A.<br />
          When apps are disabled, they still have system resources allocated to them upon startup.<br />
          Leo should completely remove unused apps rather than just disable them.<br />
          This will free up resources on the server for apps actually being used.<br />
        B.<br />
          The excessive number of apps installed are filling up the log files and causing the server to run out of disk space in the logs directory.<br />
          Leo will add more disk space.<br />
        C.<br />
          The Marketing team has likely exceeded the number of users that the system supports to simultaneously test apps.<br />
          Leo will limit the number of Marketing users able to log in at one time.<br />
        D.<br />
          Confluence Server does not support more than 60 installed apps at one time.<br />
          Leo will conduct a thorough analysis with Marketing of the top 60 apps needed and not allow any new apps to be installed.

        You are responsible for Confluence that is currently used in four countries.<br />
        The company is about to add employees in a fifth country.<br />
        You observed that peak usage of Confluence in the largest country causes performance degradation in all the other countries.<br />
        You have access to RAM, Storage and CPU resource allocations on the virtualization platform.<br />
        The networking team has identified that network bandwidth between the smallest country and Confluence is at capacity.<br />
        Which scaling strategy should you use?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Ask the space administrators to reduce the number of pages in their space, especially those in the Trash.<br />
        B. Increase the &lt;confluence-home&gt; directory to the maximum available.<br />

      <h3>Question: 29</h3>
      <p>
        You need to merge two Jira instances, to reduce support and license costs by maintaining only a single instance.<br />
        Which three statements are true about the planned merge? (Choose three.)
      </p>
      <p>
        A. If the databases are not the same on both instances (ie PostgreSQL on one and Oracle on the other), there could be some complexity involved based on data storage (i.e. apps may store data in different format/tables on each).<br />
        B. The two instances could have the same project key names, and this key conflict will cause the merge to fail.<br />
        C. A merge will take less than 12 hours, but a maintenance window is not required.  A re-index may be needed afterwards, but that can be run as a background job.<br />
        D. The merge can be done by running a simple XML export and import between the source and target server.<br />
        E. As long as the Jira versions are both of major version 6, then the merge is straightforward with a simple XML backup and restore. If they are merging versions of Jira 6 and 7, then complexity is involved.<br />
        F. The apps on the two servers must be normalized to the same version before the merge can be done.

        A. The reason for the reindex failure to complete is unrelated to the modified file(s). It is because no new data is found in the database to reindex.
        B. The jpm.xml file should never be modified, as it will be overwritten by upgrades/migrations. Replace the modified jpm.xml with the original file corresponding to the Jira version for the reindex to proceed.
        C. The Jira-application.properties file should never be modified, as it will be overwritten by upgrades/migrations. Replace the modified jira-application.properties with the original file corresponding to the Jira version for the reindex to proceed.

        <p style="font-style: italic">
          You attempt to reduce the size of the export by deleting several large spaces and pages that were created during the trial period, and that have no valid company data.

          You create an new export and you notice that the size of the export is approximately the same as before the deletion.

      <p>
        What is the best explanation for why the export size did not decrease significantly?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. You needed to restart Confluence to purge the deletion from the cache.<br />
        B. This is normal, because you cannot delete items in Confluence, you can only archive them.<br />
        C. You needed to perform an index after deletion.<br />

      <h3>Question: 40</h3>
      <p>
        A RankException error has been detected in the Jira error logs.<br />
        Your natural instinct is to run a full reindex to fix this issue with the Lucene Index.<br />
        Your co-worker is convinced this will not have any impact on fixing this particular issue.<br />
        Which one of you is correct, and why?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. You are correct. Lucene is a search engine used by Jira, and its index contains all data related to issues in Jira, including Rank. Regenerating the Lucene index will resolve this error.<br />
        B. You are correct. Both a background index and a locked full reindex are great options to fix Rank Index Exceptions.<br />
        C. Your co-worker is correct. There is no purpose in reindexing Jira because Rank Exceptions are not related to the Lucene Index. If something with the Rank Index is broken, it will most likely have to be fixed in the database itself, as this data is not generated. Therefore, regeneration is not an option.<br />
        D. You are correct. Rank Index is used by Jira and stores the position of each issue In Jira relative to each other. The data is stored in Active Objects (AO) tables within the Jira database, and read into memory on Jira startup. This data is generated. Therefore, regeneration is still an option. A reindex will fix this issue.

      <h3>Question: 48</h3>
      <p>
        You are having trouble diagnosing a Jira performance problem.<br />
        Intermittently, Jira will become very unresponsive.<br />
        The problems started approximately one month ago, when the Product Development Team was granted access to Jira, which doubled the active users count.<br />
        Now, the database monitoring tool reports show spikes and database locks, but at no predictable pattern or interval.<br />
        You looked in atlassian-jira.log but there is nothing unusual that appears during or before each spike.<br />
        You enabled SQL logging, but the amount of data logged to the file is very large (20MB each 3-4 minutes), and it is simply too challenging to find a hint in there.<br />
        You want to make only one change, and monitor the impact of the change for a week.<br />
        What should you consider next, to see if it helps determine the root cause?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Disable the database integrity checker that is set to run each evening.<br />
        B. Disable the log rotation scheduled task that runs every 4 hours in Jira.<br />
        C. Disable the database monitoring tool itself by going to Admin > System > Database  Monitoring = OFF. The tool itself may be locking Jira with the higher user count.<br />
        D. Monitor Jira’s access log for requests to the REST API. If there are no such requests, you’ve ruled out accidental Denial of Service caused by the new Development team using REST scripts against Jira.

      <h3>Question: 51</h3>
      <p>
        When you re-index the Jira Software Server, the system becomes incredibly slow, and at times it becomes unresponsive.<br />
        You've also received reports from users in recent weeks that searching, dashboards, and even the opening of issues is often incredibly slow.<br />
        Which step is most likely to reveal the cause of this issue?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Use the Support Tools log analyzer to identify performance issues.<br />
        B. Download the Atlassian Support Tools Utility to determine if disk speed is an issue.<br />
        C. Enable Garbage Collection and Memory Dumps, then analyze the memory dumps to determine the cause.<br />

        You performed upgrade testing for Jira in a pre-production environment.<br />

      <p>
        When you compared the files in the previous version to the newest version, one of the many differences in the seraph-config.xml file is:
      </p>
      <div style="border: 1px solid">
        <p style="font-style: italic">
          &lt;authenticator class=”com.atlassian.jira.security.login.JiraSeraphAuthenticator”/&gt;

      <p>
        A. The SSO authenticator is not included in this release of Jira and you will need to download it from the Atlassian website.<br />
        B. Changes to any of the critical XML configuration files are unsupported, therefore Jira has detected the changes and will not start.<br />
        C. There are changes to the seraph-config.xml file which are specific to the newest version and you will need to manually reapply changes to the authenticator directive.<br />
        D. The authenticator directive has always been incorrect and newer versions of Jira now enforce the correct syntax.

      <h3>Question: 63</h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for an on-premise Jira instance. Recently you upgraded the version of Java without restarting, activated a 25-agent license for Jira Service Desk, and configured three Jira Service Desk projects for IT, Human Resources and Finance.<br />
        You restarted Jira and verified that the latest version of Java is used.<br />
        A day after you restarted, several people informed you that issues using the Jira Service Desk email channel are not in the Jira Service Desk queue for IT. The email channel was working last week for IT.<br />
        The IT service desk manager is concerned because one of the customers who reported the problem is using Jira Service Desk for the first time this week.<br />
        Identify the possible cause for this problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        A. There can only be one active email handler in Jira.<br />
        B. The version of Java does not support the email channel functionality and you must use the previous Java version.<br />
        C. The mail handler is using the older SMTP, and following the Java update it should now be using POP3.<br />
        D. The connection to the email account failed.

      <h3>Question: 66</h3>
      <p>
        Your organization is running an older version of Jira that requires the JAVA 7 JRE.<br />
        The best way to size the virtual machine’s memory is using the recommended Jira sizing guide model shown below.<br />
        You need to identify the right VM memory size as your organization scales its use of Jira.<br />
        You have this information:
      </p>
      <div style="border: 1px solid">
        <p style="color: red">
          JVM max heap size is 4GB.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          The remaining JVM memory requirements would add another 0.5GB
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          The Guest OS memory requirement is 2GB.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
          The total VM memory size would be 6.5GB to start with, for Jira alone.
        </p>

        You are preparing to upgrade Jira Server. Your Jira Server has 10 apps installed, and one of the apps is used to provide additional workflow validators and conditions.<br />
        You checked the compatibility using the Universal plugin Manager upgrade check. You find that every app is compatible except the app used for the workflow validators and conditions.<br />
        You decide to remove this app so that the upgrade can proceed.<br />
        What will be the consequence of your action?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Issues can be created but the workflow will generate error messages such as: com.opensymphony.workflow.WorkflowException: Could not load validator class<br />
        B. The workflow conditions will continue to be evaluated and an error will be written to the issue history tab.<br />
        C. Issue types will be missing from the issue type option where the workflow scheme contains a workflow with the missing validator class.<br />
        D. Jira will function as it did before the upgrade and the workflow validator will be ignored.The upgrade from the older Jira version to the newer Jira version will fail because the app is missing

      <h3>Question: 70</h3>
      <p>
        Your organization has determined that Jira Software version X.x has essential features to the growth of your enterprise.<br />
        In preparation for the coming upgrade you execute the UPM Check compatibility feature.<br />
        It tells you that one app is likely to be incompatible with the new version of Jira Software at the time of upgrade.<br />
        Management really wants the update, despite the possible problems brought on by this impending incompatibility. They depend on your expertise to make the final determination if the upgrade should proceed in the near future. What are two possible ways to handle this potential app incompatibility? (Choose two.)
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Upgrade the app when upgrading Jira Software, then immediately down-grade to previous working version of the app.<br />
        B. Consult with users about the possible loss of functionality they might suffer with the app not being enabled.<br />
        C. The incompatibility warnings are almost always cosmetic. Proceed with the upgrade.<br />
        D. Discuss with app vendor the possible data integrity ramifications that could occur if the app is temporarily disabled.<br />
        E. Try the app in UPM compatibility mode to see if it will function in an upgraded instance.

        You just hired a junior system administrator for the night shift at your organization.<br />
        Your company has very strict change management rules for your Atlassian suite of applications.<br />
        You want to ensure that your new admin has the proper OS access to diagnose any issue and determine if an escalation needs to be made. You do not want to give permission to change the environment.<br />
        Which configuration modifications will accommodate these requirements?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Allow the administrator to have r/o access to the install directories but r/w access to the data subdirectories.<br />
        B. Configure the OS so the new administrator can have temporary | ‘sudo’ or ‘Administrator’ access to the OS.<br />
        C. Create an atlassian group in OS, put the admin in the group and then grant that group read access to all install/data directories.<br />
        D. Grant the administrator access to the Jira file browser/view utility in the Jira GUI.

      <h3>Question: 72</h3>
      <p>
        Due to company wide restrictions, you will no longer be granted support for the<br />
        MySQL database you are using with your Jira instance with 500 users.<br />
        Instead, your manager demands that all applications use an Oracle database.<br />
        In order for Jira and its components to remain supported by your IT and DBAs, you will follow this direction.<br />
        Considering the technical possibilities, what is the safest way to perform this action?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Ask your internal development team to develop a service that pulls data from the old database and converts it for the new database.<br />
        B. Create an XML-backup in Jira and import it to another instance using Oracle’s built-in tools.<br />
        C. Create a JSON-backup in Jira and import it to another instance which has been installed using the Oracle database.<br />
        D. Create an XML-backup in Jira and import it to another instance which has been installed using the Oracle database.<br />
        E. Disconnect Jira from your MySQL database and reconnect it to the Oracle database so it will automatically populate the database with all contents.

        What is the most serious problem you will face, using this database backup method to recover from this hacking event?

      <p>
        A. Replicated copies of the database are, by nature, read-only.<br />
        B. Due to network lag, not all data from the master database will be included in the replicated copy.<br />
        C. You will suffer some downtime switching from the primary to the replicated database.<br />

      <h3>Question: 74</h3>
      <p>
        You manage a Jira server on-premise that is accessed by an external partner company.<br />
        They are complaining that it is running slowly when accessing it from their browsers.<br />
        Your supervisor has asked you to investigate the root cause.<br />
        There is a reverse proxy in front of Jira. It enforces that no one can connect directly to Jira except the reverse proxy server itself.<br />
        You wonder if the reverse proxy in front of the Jira server is actually the culprit of the users slow Jira experience.<br />
        Due to security concerns, all users must always access Jira through the reverse proxy.<br />
        For testing purposes, your supervisor approved you bypassing it to test your hypothesis.<br />
        All other users must continue to use the reverse proxy during your tests.<br />
        What modification do you need to make so that you can bypass the reverse proxy to test your assumption?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. Modify &lt;jira-install-directory&gt;/conf/server.xml to allow netstat, ping, and traceroute commands to be activated so you can verify diagnostic figures from Jira directly.<br />
        B. Introduce an additional HTTP connector port in Jira by modifying &lt;jira-install-directory&gt;/conf/server.xml. The connector must use a port number not already in use by Jira.<br />
        C. Remove all SSL certificates from the reverse proxy, effectively making it a forward proxy. This will allow you to test Jira directly.<br />
        D. Introduce a VPN tunnel from your computer to the Jira server that will allow you to browse the Jira application directly, without needing to make any modifications to the Jira configuration of the reverse proxy settings.<br />
